# Vision
This project contains a simple C project that tries to recognize image types. The primary reason this project exists is so I can get some experience with the C programming language.

## Planned features
* recognize the image type, if it is a supported type.
* be able to find the height and width of the image.
* pass a folder as a command line argument, and run every file through the program to see if it recognizes the type.

### Supported filetypes
* JPG
* PNG
